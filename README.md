# 🔬 Valgrind-RS

A work-in-progress **Valgrind-style memory analysis tool** written in **Rust**, designed to detect memory errors in **C programs**. This project is both a learning journey and an experimental re-implementation of key concepts behind Valgrind — including binary parsing, shadow memory, and instruction-level simulation.

> ⚠️ This is an educational project under active development. Expect rough edges and experimental code.

## 🎯 Goals

- 🧠 Learn Rust by recreating a complex systems tool
- 🏗️ Build a dynamic analysis framework for native C binaries
- 🛠️ Manually parse ELF files, implement shadow memory, and simulate CPU behavior
- 🔍 Detect invalid reads/writes, use-after-free, and memory leaks

## 🛠️ Architecture Overview

| Component           | Status | Description |
|---------------------|--------|-------------|
| ELF Loader          | 🚧 WIP | Parses ELF headers and segments manually |
| Shadow Memory Model | 🔜     | Mirrors program memory with metadata for validity tracking |
| Memory Hooks        | 🔜     | Intercepts `malloc`, `free`, stack, global allocations |
| Instruction Engine  | 🔜     | Decodes and simulates basic x86/x86-64 instructions |
| Analyzer Core       | 🔜     | Detects memory misuse during simulation |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🧱 Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+
- Linux (ELF64 support only for now)
- x86_64 target binaries

### 📦 Build & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arkcadia/rustgrind.git
cd valgrind-rs
cargo build --release

# Run on a binary
cargo run -- /path/to/c-program
